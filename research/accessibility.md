## Closed Captions

### Issues

- Open Captions are totally inaccessible
  - they're burned into the video and cannot be turned off
- Captions need to be read automatically by SR
- Overly complex text (that you might want to pause and read)
- Scrolling captions
  - place the next line below the previous, pushing the latter up
  - need to be properly tagged

### How to Test Captions

- TBD
